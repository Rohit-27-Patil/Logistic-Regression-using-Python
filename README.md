# Logistic-Regression-using-Python

This repository contains Python code for performing logistic regression analysis on a dataset. The analysis includes tasks such as visualizing categorical features, exploring relationships between categorical features, visualizing categorical variables with numerical variables, identifying factors leading to low grades of students, and building a classification model with its classification report.

## Files

- `Class Assessment 4.ipynb`: Python script containing the code for logistic regression analysis.
- `xAPI-Edu-Data.csv`: Sample dataset file used for analysis. Replace with your own dataset.
